[NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/) replaced NYC Datamine around 2011. While it serves the New York City data community. There are often issues with the provinence, accuracy, continuity and usability of the data. While the [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) platform allows users to comment, often these comments go unheard and there is no master list.

The purposed of the NYC Open Data Community website is to provide a place for all these issues and possible solutions to be raised and discussed.
